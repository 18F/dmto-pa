# DTMO Path Analysis
Path Analysis with the Defense Travel Management Office’s (DTMO), an office responsible for managing travel and housing allowances for Service members and their families.

## Prototyping a web version of the JTR
In our research, we found that travel administrators referred to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) every day but had to download the PDF every day because it was updated constantly and they needed to be up to date. We want to test a quick prototype for a web version of the JTR to see if this is a viable idea to continue in the next phase of work.

## About DTMO
The DTMO serves as the focal point for commercial travel within DoD, providing central oversight for commercial travel management, travel policy and implementation, travel card program management, customer support and training, functional oversight of the Defense Travel System (DTS), and allowance program management.  By centralizing travel functions
under one organization, the Department is able to standardize management practices, leverage economies of scale, reduce administrative costs, and work towards a common set of goals.  DTMO is focused on travel and allowance reform that simplifies travel policy and drives compliance, expands strategic sourcing opportunities, improves programs/processes, leverages current technologies, and reduces the overall cost of travel without impairing DoD’s mission.

### DTMO is an office of DHRA 
The DHRA (Defense Human Resources Activity) is the premier provider of human resources management services to Departmental leaders, civilians, military members, their families, and retirees. The Field Activity provides extensive support functions to internal and external customers, anticipating emerging mission requirements, pursuing new perspectives and insights to provide innovative, targeted solutions and the best, most cost-effective programs and services.
